A high-performance command and control (C2) framework written in Go, featuring enterprise-grade security with TLS 1.3 encryption, multi-user management, attack orchestration, and comprehensive audit logging.

> **⚠️ Development Status**: This project is currently in active development. Please star or watch the repository to stay updated with releases.

## 🎯 Overview

This C2 framework provides a secure, scalable solution for network operations with robust authentication, role-based access control, and real-time bot management. Built with modern Go practices and enterprise security standards.

### Key Highlights
- **Enterprise Security**: TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication and certificate pinning
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multi-user system with role-based permissions
- **Attack Orchestration**: 8+ attack vectors with intelligent queuing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live bot tracking and connection management
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Full activity logging with automatic rotation
  
## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Go 1.21+**
- **OpenSSL** (for certificate generation)
- **Linux/Unix Environment** (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-c2.git
   cd golang-c2
   ```

2. **Generate TLS Certificates**
   ```bash
   # Create certificates directory
   mkdir -p certs
   
   # Generate server certificate
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
   
   # Generate CA certificate
   openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.csr -nodes
   openssl x509 -req -in certs/ca.csr -signkey certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.crt
   
   # Generate client certificates
   openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/client.key -out certs/client.csr -nodes
   openssl x509 -req -in certs/client.csr -CA certs/ca.crt -CAkey certs/ca.key -out certs/client.crt -days 365
   ```

3. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   # Build the server
   go build -o c2server main.go
   
   # Run the server
   ./c2server
   ```

### Connecting to the Server

**Important**: This C2 server requires OpenSSL for connection - standard SSH clients are not supported.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect [SERVER_IP]:[PORT] -cert client.crt -key client.key -CAfile ca.crt
```

Ensure all certificate files (.crt, .key, and CA bundle) are in your working directory before connecting.

## 📋 Usage
